# Smart Contract Deployment Guide for Remix IDE

## Overview
This guide will help you deploy the MoonFi smart contracts using Remix IDE.

## Contracts to Deploy
1. **CreditProfile.sol** - Manages on-chain credit scores and loan history
2. **LendingPool.sol** - Handles deposits, borrowing, and repayments

---

## Step-by-Step Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Open Remix IDE
1. Go to https://remix.ethereum.org/
2. You'll see the Remix IDE interface

### Step 2: Create Contract Files

#### Create CreditProfile.sol
1. In the **File Explorer** (left sidebar), click on the **contracts** folder
2. Click the **Create New File** icon
3. Name it `CreditProfile.sol`
4. Copy the entire contents from `contracts/CreditProfile.sol` and paste it into Remix

#### Create LendingPool.sol
1. Create another new file named `LendingPool.sol`
2. Copy the entire contents from `contracts/LendingPool.sol` and paste it into Remix

### Step 3: Compile the Contracts

1. Click on the **Solidity Compiler** icon (left sidebar, second icon)
2. Select compiler version: **0.8.20** or higher (0.8.20+)
3. Click **Compile CreditProfile.sol**
4. You should see a green checkmark if compilation is successful
5. Click **Compile LendingPool.sol**
6. Verify both contracts compile without errors

### Step 4: Deploy CreditProfile Contract First

1. Click on the **Deploy & Run Transactions** icon (left sidebar, third icon)
2. Select **Environment**:
   - For testing: Choose **Remix VM (Shanghai)** or **Remix VM (London)**
   - For testnet: Choose **Injected Provider - MetaMask** (make sure MetaMask is connected)
   - For mainnet: ‚ö†Ô∏è **Be very careful!** Use **Injected Provider - MetaMask** on mainnet

3. In the **Contract** dropdown, select **CreditProfile**
4. Click **Deploy** (orange button)
5. **IMPORTANT:** Copy the deployed contract address from the **Deployed Contracts** section
   - It will look like: `0x123...abc`
   - Save this address - you'll need it for the next step!

### Step 5: Deploy LendingPool Contract

1. In the **Contract** dropdown, select **LendingPool**
2. You'll see a text field next to the **Deploy** button (for constructor parameters)
3. Paste the **CreditProfile contract address** you copied in Step 4
   - Format: `"0x123...abc"` (include the quotes)
4. Click **Deploy**
5. **IMPORTANT:** Copy the deployed **LendingPool** contract address
   - Save this address - you'll need it for frontend integration!

### Step 6: Verify Deployment

1. In the **Deployed Contracts** section, you should see both contracts listed
2. Expand **CreditProfile** contract and try calling:
   - `getScore` with your wallet address
   - Should return `500` (base credit score)
3. Expand **LendingPool** contract and try calling:
   - `getPoolStats`
   - Should return initial pool statistics

---

## Post-Deployment: Frontend Integration

After deploying, you need to update your frontend with the contract addresses.

### Update Contract Addresses

Edit `src/hooks/useContract.js` and replace the zero addresses:

```javascript
// Replace these with your deployed contract addresses
const LENDING_POOL_ADDRESS = 'YOUR_LENDING_POOL_ADDRESS_HERE';
const CREDIT_PROFILE_ADDRESS = 'YOUR_CREDIT_PROFILE_ADDRESS_HERE';
```

---

## Testing the Contracts in Remix

### Test CreditProfile

1. Call `initializeProfile` with a test address
2. Call `getScore` with the same address - should return 500
3. Call `recordLoan` with: address, amount (in wei), interest rate (500 = 5%)
4. Call `getLoanHistory` to see the recorded loan

### Test LendingPool

1. Call `deposit` with value: 1 ETH (1000000000000000000 wei)
2. Call `getLenderBalance` with your address - should show deposited amount
3. Try `borrow` with a small amount (0.1 ETH = 100000000000000000 wei)
4. Call `getBorrowerLoan` to see loan details
5. Call `repay` with the total owed amount to repay the loan

## Network Recommendations

### For Testing (Recommended for Initial Development)
- **Remix VM**: Free, instant, no real ETH needed
- Perfect for testing contract logic

### For Testnet Deployment
1. **Sepolia Testnet** (Recommended)
   - Get test ETH from: https://sepoliafaucet.com/
   - Network: Sepolia in MetaMask

2. **Mumbai (Polygon Testnet)**
   - Get test MATIC from: https://faucet.polygon.technology/
   - Lower gas fees

### For Mainnet (Production)
- **Ethereum Mainnet**: High gas fees, high security
- **Polygon Mainnet**: Low gas fees, good for DeFi
- **Arbitrum/Optimism**: Layer 2 solutions, lower fees

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Considerations:**
1. These contracts have NOT been audited
2. DO NOT deploy to mainnet with real funds without a professional audit
3. Test thoroughly on testnet first
4. Consider adding access control (Ownable) for production

‚ö†Ô∏è **Gas Optimization:**
1. Deployment will cost gas (testnet = free test ETH, mainnet = real ETH)
2. Each transaction costs gas
3. Consider batch operations for production

‚ö†Ô∏è **Frontend Integration:**
1. After deployment, update contract addresses in frontend
2. Make sure your frontend is connected to the same network
3. Update ABIs if you make any changes to contracts

---

## Troubleshooting

### Compilation Errors
- Make sure compiler version is 0.8.20 or higher
- Check for syntax errors
- Verify all imports are correct

### Deployment Failures
- Check you have enough ETH/MATIC for gas
- Verify constructor parameters are correct (LendingPool needs CreditProfile address)
- Make sure MetaMask is connected to correct network

### Transaction Failures
- Check you have enough balance for deposits/repayments
- Verify credit score requirements for borrowing
- Ensure loan limits are not exceeded

## Contract Addresses (Fill After Deployment)

```
Network: _______________

CreditProfile Address: 0x_______________________________________________

LendingPool Address: 0x_______________________________________________

Deployment Date: _______________

Deployer Address: 0x_______________________________________________
```

---

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. ‚úÖ Save contract addresses
2. ‚úÖ Update frontend configuration
3. ‚úÖ Test all functions
4. ‚úÖ Document any issues
5. ‚úÖ Share addresses with frontend team
6. ‚úÖ Consider getting contracts audited before mainnet
